# yunity

> ... imagine sharing everything

yunity encourages relationships where people can share their time, skills and resources unconditionally. Through these connections and communities we prevent waste and raise awareness for a sustainable way of living.

Our vision is a society based on self-determination, trust and cooperation which allows people to live to their full potential and to preserve ecosystems for all living beings.

We are a network made up of subprojects. Look in the menu for details of these.

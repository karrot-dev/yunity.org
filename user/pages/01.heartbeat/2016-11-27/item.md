The yunity heartbeat - what has each team done, what are they doing and what do they need help with.

* * *

### WuppHouse BaDue.

As we already told you in [the last heartbeat](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/YUN/2016/11/16/yunity+heartbeat+2016-11-13) , we found [a house](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=74776581) !

The old train station in Bad Dürrenberg is now inhabited by yunity folk since almost three weeks. The mood goes up and down and people come and go, but there _is_ progress after all:

*   We have running water and flushable toilets
*   We have DSL and a landline telephone connection
*   We have two heatable rooms
*   We already got rid of _a lot_ of rubble
*   We already talked to lots of people and found many who want to support us
*   We have more tools, than fit into our cabinet (even though some are still missing)
*   We have a post box
*   We have started to set up [wupphaus.yunity.org](http://wupphaus.yunity.org) to have a specifically dedicated website

On top of that we had a talk with the mayor, who seems supportive, some other local politicians, entrepreneurs and press people and [we even got featured in the local newspaper](http://www.mz-web.de/saalekreis/initiative-fuer-bahnhofsgebaeude-von-ruine-zum-wupp-haus-in-bad-duerrenberg-25153152) , with a big picture and all! ![](/user/themes/twentyfifteen/images/emoticons/smile.png)

Also, we are planning an event and [a survey](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=77299730) to include the local community of Bad Dürrenberg even more into what we are doing. We want to create something beneficial to everyone living there after all, and we don't want to be isolated in our building but truly be part of the city!

Still, there is a lot of love and work needed to make this dream come true and help is needed on every front! So if you'd like to lend a hand please do so, and rather sooner than later... ![](/user/themes/twentyfifteen/images/emoticons/wink.png) In the meantime enjoy some [ impressions from the site ](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BADUE/Impressions+from+the+site) and you'll see that we really need you! ^^

### About the heartbeat.

The heartbeat is a biweekly summary of what happens in yunity. It is meant to give an overview over our currents actions and topics.

##### When and how does it happen?

Every other weekend we collect information on a wiki page and publish it the following Monday as a wiki blog article. Afterwards we add a nice abstract and share it on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/yunity.org/) .

The yunity heartbeat - what has each team done, what are they doing and what do they need help with.

* * *

### Foodsaving Tool.

In [the last heartbeat](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/YUN/2016/11/28/yunity+heartbeat+2016-11-27) we showed you how much progress was already made with regards to the foodsaving tool. Now guess what? It is ready for testing!

This is, of course, a pretty arbitrarily set point in the development, because the tool is not _really_ done, but then again, will it ever be? It will constantly be improved and expanded in the future as well, but from now on with the valuable feedback of actual foodsavers using it!

We already offered the tool to the foodsaving communities in Nantes, in Warsaw and to the rogue foodsavers of Magdeburg, who will hopefully provide us with insights on how to make it better and enhance its usability. More groups, like the ones in Taiwan, Copenhagen, Russia, Ankara (or yours..?) will probably follow.

You want to check it out yourself? Then just go [here](https://fstool.yunity.org/#!/login) , create an account and click around! Anything you notice, that confuses or disappoints you? Tell us in [#foodsaving-tool-plan](https://yunity.slack.com/messages/foodsaving-tool-plan/) on Slack or send us a mail at [fstool@yunity.org](https://yunity.atlassian.netmailto:fstool@yunity.org) ! The mails will be received and read for sure, but we won't send out answers, since you can always come to our Slack if you want to have a chat... ![](/user/themes/twentyfifteen/images/emoticons/wink.png)

You want to know all the nerdy details or are even ready to contribute to the further development of the tool yourself? Amazing! Then visit [the project on github](https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-frontend) , [join the team](https://project.yunity.org/join-the-team) and talk to us in [#foodsaving-tool](https://yunity.slack.com/messages/foodsaving-tool/) and [#foodsaving-tool-plan](https://yunity.slack.com/messages/foodsaving-tool-plan/) on Slack. Be sure that we'll welcome you with open arms! Especially now with more people actually giving feedback, there will be _a lot_ to do, so we could _really_ use some more motivated developers!

### WuppHouse Bad Dürrenberg.

![](2016-12-11/outdoorbreakfast.jpg)

The first WuppHouse is the second big topic in yunity since more than a month now, and a lot is going on there as well! Sadly it's not all good news, but let's start with the nice stuff:

*   We installed a free phone and free wifi accessible from the train platform on the northern wall of the building
*   We received a _huge_ amount of support from local people
*   We got featured multiple times in local media, be it [another newspaper article](http://www.mz-web.de/saalekreis/freier-internetzugang-darum-soll-der-bahnhof-zum-wupp-haus-werden-25199190?dmcid=sm_fb) , a short mention on Radio Brocken or the ten minute long radio interview with [Philip Engelbutzeder](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~Philip) , which is [now transcribed as well](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/YUN/2016-11+Radio+interview+with+Philip+at+Witzenhausen) (for the audio version have a look in [the last heartbeat](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/YUN/2016/11/28/yunity+heartbeat+2016-11-27) )

*   We made [a video showing the progress](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BADUE/2016-11-30) until 16-11-30. [Selina Camile](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~Selina) and [Lara Earthling](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~rose+earthling) charmingly show you the building and explain what already happened. It's in German but also full of visual impressions... ![](/user/themes/twentyfifteen/images/emoticons/wink.png)
*   We arranged a bath night, fully equipped with a heatable bathtub, drinks and food, see picture below!

So you see we still move forward and know how to have a nice time in the ruins of the old train station in Bad Dürrenberg, but it's not all sunshine and roses...

[Lara Earthling](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~rose+earthling) , [Anna](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~Mythily_Robin_Anna) and [Bodhi Neiser](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~Bodhi) filmed three update videos about the big topics Bürgerdialog, inspection of the site together with a knowledgeable architect and the then following meeting of the present yuniteers to evaluate how to deal with the new information.

1.  [First update](https://youtu.be/BHWpQHdKRhk) - Bürgerdialog/talk with the citizens on December 3rd
2.  [Second update](https://youtu.be/a-tmC9RoWUM) - inspection of the site and feedback of an architect
3.  [Third update](https://youtu.be/hHQe5EQvydU) - implications for the yuniteers living in Bad Dürrenberg now

As you can see, there are positive as well as negative aspects and the most dire information probably was that there would not be the realistic possibility to actually live inside the building somewhat healthily and comfortably anytime soon.

![](2016-12-11/bodhimatthias_bath1.jpg)

That led to many people leaving - at least temporarily - and to some starting to look for different houses again. (Funnily some days later already a mail reached us stating that there will be a cool project making use of a whole [Plattenbau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plattenbau) north of Leipzig soon, and that they need people to populate the building. But this is just a side note for now... ![](/user/themes/twentyfifteen/images/emoticons/smile.png) )

So there are still yunity people living and wupping in Bad Dürrenberg and they plan on staying! We still have the huge support of local people and media. The building still offers great potential! So if you want to lend a hand, you can definitely still do so! (Maybe ask in [#wupphouse_badue](https://yunity.slack.com/messages/wupphouse_badue/) on Slack about the current situation before you come visit, just to make sure you'll directly find someone when you arrive.) But to assess for yourself how serious we still are about this opportunity, just read this:

*   People are still planning to come by the WuppHouse - be it over Christmas and New Year's Eve or sometime before, after or in between. Wanna come, too? Check and fill out [the attendance poll](https://poll.disroot.org/quZI8rLHN4jl31Jg) !
*   [Matthias Larisch](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~matthias) had legal consultation about what kind of entity would be useful to create for the WuppHouse project.
*   [Philip Engelbutzeder](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~Philip) brought together all kinds of thoughts regarding the use of money - a topic that was raised quite often already in yunity - and wrote [a page on the wiki](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=78643219) about it. Since it is mainly focused on the WuppHouse in Bad Dürrenberg for now and should be seen as a work-in-progress anyways, his text is written in German.
*   The [survey targeting to find out the needs of the citizens of Bad Dürrenberg](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=77299730) was launched by [Paul Free](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~Paul+Free) and [Philip Engelbutzeder](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~Philip) .
*   [Douglas Webb](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~dmhwebb) spread the word even in Scotland and raised the possibility that "perhaps we'll get a fleet of charitable architects". ![](/user/themes/twentyfifteen/images/emoticons/wink.png)
*   The [pretty detailed list of networking activities](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BADUE/Contacts+to+authorities+and+press) gets updated constantly.

* * *

### Foodsharing/-saving Worldwide.

#### Done

*   [Tilmann](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~tiltec) and [Janina Abels](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~Janina) are networking and spreading the word in Lyon ( [ANT](https://www.facebook.com/groups/148696302145807/) - dumpster diver's group, [alimentation solidaire](http://initiatives-durables.monts-du-lyonnais.fr/initiatives/pour-une-alimentation-solidaire) - a group that saves food directly from producers in the countryside west of Lyon)

This time not only on [the private-to-private sharing on vk.com](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/FSINT/Existing+initiatives#Existinginitiatives-RUSSIA-VKFoodsharingpage) , but a _real_ foodsharing initiative, complete with cooperations, quiz and all!

#### In Progress

*   Many of us are traveling still or again, be it [Tilmann](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~tiltec) on his never-ending bike tour, partly accompanied by [Janina Abels](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~Janina) ; [Tais Real](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~Tais) and [Nick Sellen](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~nicksellen) hitchhiking through the UK or actually every single one of us who change their location now and then and almost always talk to people on the road about yunity and foodsaving.

* * *

### Design.

#### Done

*   The sister of [Andreas Langecker](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~chandi) has provided a nice logo for the foodsaving tool, which is more bright and playful as the first one: ![](2016-12-11/fstoollogo_chandisys.jpg)

*   Inspired by Robert's experience [Fenja Jacobs](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/~fenja.jacobs) remembered that she had already summarized [two books on how to use newsletter most efficiently](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/YUN/Newsletter+Guidelines) a while ago and shared her work with us as well!

### About the heartbeat.

The heartbeat is a biweekly summary of what happens in yunity. It is meant to give an overview over our currents actions and topics.

##### When and how does it happen?

Every other weekend we collect information on a wiki page and publish it the following Monday as a wiki blog article. Afterwards we add a nice abstract and share it on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/yunity.org/) .

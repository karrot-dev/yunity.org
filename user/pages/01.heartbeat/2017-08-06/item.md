**The yunity heartbeat** - news from the world of sharing, fresh every two weeks.

## [foodsharing.de](https://foodsharing.de)

## [foodsaving.world](https://foodsaving.world)

Ines and Marie from RGSoC are [working to finalize](https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-backend/issues/253#issuecomment-318612543) the [pick-up feedback feature](https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-frontend/issues/159) on the back-end, while Lars already created [an user interface draft](https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-frontend/pull/581).

In an activity surge, Nick made much progress on [his back-end implementation](https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-backend/pull/333) of the _Conversations_ feature, awaiting review now. Whilst working on that, he also had the idea to improve the test infrastructure, namely [watching files for changes and running only affected test](https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-backend/pull/334). All that to boost our test coverage further up, even it's [already on 98%](https://codecov.io/gh/yunity/foodsaving-backend)!

### Further changes and improvements

- Users can add their location, members of the group can see where other members are located. This feature is meant to improve pick-up coordination and sharing of food.
- The store overview map got much more responsive: it zooms to the currently selected store and shows other stores and users with reduced opacity

- The location input is now the same on group, store and user forms and the visibility of the address search field has been improved
- "Home" button added to all pages that links to the landing page
- Store list gets now sorted by name
- Bug fix: store map was sometimes not visible when the store didn't have an address
- Refresh data from the server when clicking on stores and the group. If two users were modifying data, it could lead to outdated values before. 
- Fix "blank page" bug when user is logged out or URL is invalid. It redirects to the login page now.
- The backend development setup should be easier now thanks to [the Dockerfile](https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-backend/pull/331) created by Ines, Marie and their coaches.
- `Django-channels` for doing _websockets_ were added in preparation of the _Conversations_ feature
- When signing up, E-Mail addresses are now [considered case-insensitive](https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-backend/pull/327) to prevent errors. For example, `test@example.com` and `Test@example.com` can't be used at the same time.
- The API documentation is now only available via `/docs/`, e.g. [foodsaving.world/docs/](https://foodsaving.world/docs/), while `/api/` returns raw `JSON` data.

## News from foodsaving groups

An [article about Foodsharing Maastricht](https://foodsaving.today/en/blog/2017/07/29/foodsharing-maastricht-discovery) was added to [foodsaving.today](https://foodsaving.today):

> Recently, we picked up food from three smaller supermarkets on a regular basis and we started to cooperate with the food supplier of the university, which already greatly improves the sustainability of our university. On a national level, we just joined the Dutch-wide Foodsharing foundation, which was also just recently founded.

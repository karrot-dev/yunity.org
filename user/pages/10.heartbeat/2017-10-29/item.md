**The yunity heartbeat** - news from the world of sharing, fresh every two weeks.

## Foodsaving Worldwide
Sooo many mails! You guys out there are really amazing! And all of a sudden you all reach out to us! :D This is exactly what we wanted, but lately we really feel a shortage of (wo)manpower to handle all the communication needed to answer everybody's questions. So if you wrote a mail to us and have not yet received an answer, please don't be disappointed: We will definitely get back to you, it may just take a while. Sorry!

### foodsaving.world
The huge influx of emails motivated us, however, to speed up the process to put the new landing page for foodsaving.world online. It will make much more information directly accessible to people, who just come by and want some answers to questions like:
- How to start a foodsaving group?
- How to manage pick-ups and cooperations?
- How to set up a Food-Share Point?
- What other groups are already out there?
- Who can I talk to, to get more in-depth coaching?
- Where can I share my group's story of success and/or the challenges we face(d)?

## Kanthaus
Nick and Cille became volunteers and Janina finally moved in! Nick wants to organize hackathons at Kanthaus and make sure, the place can support events like those. Cille wants to help where she can and follow spontaneous surges of creative energy to improve the house. Janina wants to push the official foodsaving and intensify contact to the food bank.

On Thursday 26th the second monthly foodsharing Wurzen meeting was held and the facebook group Rainer founded already has attracted more than 80 members, one of which is mayor Jörg Röglin. The next steps are to contact more small stores and maybe even take over some cooperations of the food bank, which has limited resources at the moment and therefore stopped most of its pick-ups.

This weekend until Tuesday 31st the Germany-wide foodsharing festival season 2017 retrospective meeting also takes place at Kanthaus. It's the first bigger event and we are all very excited how it will play out. Our nice neighbor Sven provided electricity for this important weekend and hopefully the weather will stay warm, so that we won't miss heating too much... ;)

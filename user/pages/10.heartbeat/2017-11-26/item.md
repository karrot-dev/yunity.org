Foodsharing Quito is expanding! The group in the capital of Ecuador already has 3 cooperations running and is in contact with two more stores. On top of that they saved food at a vegan food festival and have an active group with 50 members on facebook. Keep going strong! :)

On the other hand foodsharing Taiwan is facing a difficulty at the moment: Some stores are worrying, that they lose customers because of their cooperation. One bakery apparently even reported that some of the foodsavers were customers before and now buy less. This is not easy to resolve, but we'll do our best to work on a solution together!

## WuppDays Dargelütz

Over the course of the last week the [WuppDays Dargelütz](http://dargeluetz.weebly.com/solidarity-economy-wuppdays.html) took place! The focus lay on community and the question of how to organize communal economy in a way that fits the value of solidarity. We were a group of around 10 people, who gathered in the tiny village of Dargelütz, where the [VFS](http://dargeluetz.weebly.com/der-vfs-ev.html) has property and commits it to experiments of community since more than 20 years.

There were talks and workshops about alternative currencies, experiences with different communities and how they chose to organize their economies, as well as warm baths - heated up sustainably via the newly-built [Biomeiler](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomeiler) - and vegan food. It was small, cozy and surprisingly chill WuppDays this time... ;)

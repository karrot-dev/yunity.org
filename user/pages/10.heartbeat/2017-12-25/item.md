**The yunity heartbeat** - news from the world of sharing, fresh every two weeks.

On December 14 Lise, Bodhi, Matthias, Janina and Axel held a pitch at Social Impact Lab Stuttgart. They presented the newly created project _REsource_, which acts as an umbrella for all the things happening at Kanthaus. The pitch itself lasted only 5 minutes, followed by 5 minutes of questions, but it was prepared for hours and hours over weeks before. As you can imagine it was not easy at all to explain the idea of sustainable living, based on community and trust instead of money and luxury to a jury of entrepreneurs in such a short time. They basically did not understand what we are doing and of course they were missing a business plan, so we were not picked. But this was neither surprising nor sad to us and we all had the feeling that we learned a lot from this experience and that all the thoughts we had and the texts we created will definitely be of use in other contexts again.

Apart from that Bj√∂rn and Janina went to [Querbeet]() on Saturday 16 to help out with a foodsharing KifA (Kitchen for All) at the sustainable Christmas market, that was taking place in this neighborhood garden on that day.

You may have noticed that we had some problems regarding translations on our homepage so far. That's why Matthias recreated it using grav and now other language versions should work much more smoothly. It is not yet deployed to our main link, but you can have a peek already at [grav.kantaus.online](https://grav.kanthaus.online).

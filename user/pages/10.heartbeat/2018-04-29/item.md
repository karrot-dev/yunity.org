On the 2nd ever [World Disco Soup Day](https://www.slowfood.com/what-we-do/international-events/world-disco-soup-day/), soup and tunes united Disco Soupers at [more than 100 events](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=12ypv0JDXaQSlnLgye0NMxf_PGS6UETtU&ll=-3.81666561775622e-14%2C13.948718060292208&z=1) all around the globe, in the fight against food waste! What a huge success for [Slow Food International](https://www.facebook.com/slowfoodinternational/) and all foodsavers!

## [Karrot](https://karrot.world)
More and more users find their way onto Karrot! There are new groups for Warsaw and Genève and the groups for Bilbao, Quito, Östersund, Maastricht, Wageningen and Lund are steadily growing! That makes it fitting that user support is the thing mostly done in the Karrot department right now and development is mostly on hold. Nick is cycling and maintaining family bonds, Tilmann spends more of his time and energy on Kanthaus building tasks and Lukas and Lars are busy with their studies.

A rather sad piece of news is that - even though we were one of the most popular projects - we did not get any RGSoC team this year. It's probably due to them not having found as much money as in the past, but it's unexpected still. Only upside: Tais and Janina will become Karrot Rails Girls anyways, so the general summer of code will happen after all! More internally that is... ;)

**The yunity heartbeat** - news from the world of sharing, fresh every two weeks.

The past weeks were consuming by getting used to F# and figuring out how things work with the fable - the compiler that turns F# into Js.

Ukuvota has a new navigation bar and can now parse markdown files! The next task is to create the interface for a Group view and possibly add some input fields.
